# RBSG-EBSG-Benchmark

A benchmark used for evaluation of the two snippet generation approaches RBSG and EBSG. The benchmark is based on ESBM[Liu+20], which is another benchmark for entity summarizers.

RBSG is a reasoning based snippet generator, where materialization is the reasoning method.

EBSG is an embedding based snippet generator, where pyRDF2Vec[Ste+23] is the embedding method.
